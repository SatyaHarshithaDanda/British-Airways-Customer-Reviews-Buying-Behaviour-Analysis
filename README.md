# British Airways Data Science Job Simulation on Forage

## Overview

This project is part of the Data Science virtual internship program offered by Forage in collaboration with British Airways.

The virtual internship is divided into two main tasks:

### Task 1: Web Scraping to Gain Company Insights
- Customers who book a flight with British Airways (BA) will experience many interaction points with the BA brand. Understanding customer feelings, needs, and feedback is crucial for any business, including BA.
- This task involves scraping and collecting customer feedback and review data from a third-party source (Skytrax), and analyzing this data to uncover insights.

### Task 2: Predicting Customer Buying Behavior
- Today's customers are more empowered than ever due to access to a wealth of information. This empowerment has changed the buying cycle significantly.
- The task involves building a high-quality predictive model to forecast successful bookings using customer booking data.
